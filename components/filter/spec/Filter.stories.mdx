# Filter

A component to sift through a list of items or information.

<Preview withToolbar>
  <Story name="Filter">
    <Filter />
  </Story>
</Preview>

<Props of={ Filter } />


## When to use this component

Use the filter component to help users filter a list of items, such as a list of cases or search results.

You should only provide users with filters they really need.


## How to use

Users can select 1 or more filters. When the user clicks 'Apply filters' the page refreshes to show the items that match the filters.

The selected filters are displayed at the top or side to let users see what they've selected and remove them easily.
Clicking on a selected filter refreshes the page and removes the filter.


## How it works

The filter component is a short link that expands into more detailed filtering options when a user clicks on it.
You can use form elements such as radios and checkboxes to let users filter the list.



## Research

This component has been used on LITE to sift through cases and view certain information at a glance.
